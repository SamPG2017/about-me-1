# about-me
About Me project for Week 1 of Code 201. 

## Game Mission
As a student at CodeFellows, I want to make a website that not only promotes my coding skills but also teaches the user something about me in a fun and creative way through the use of a guessing game.

## Build Status
Useable but still in-progress

## Example JS
<!-- figure out how to include the line numbers when including it into the README.md -->
>var fearQuakes = prompt ('Have I experienced any earthquakes before? ' + yorn);
>if(fearQuakes.toLowerCase() === 'yes' || fearQuakes.toLowerCase === 'y'){
>  alert('NOOOO. Maybe if I did, I wouldn\'t be so scared');
>}else{
>  alert('No earthquakes yet, but my parents have had two in Madison, Mississippi in the last 4 years. Fracking awesome, right?');
>}
>console.log(userName + ' knows I\'ve never experienced the earth quake?' + fearQuakes);
