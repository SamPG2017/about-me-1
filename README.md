About Me project for Week 1 of Code 201. 

## Game Mission
Create a game for a user to test their knowledge of **my** *_fantastic_* life through a series of yes or no questions. 

## Build Status
Useable but still in-progress

## Example JS
>var fearQuakes = prompt ('Have I experienced any earthquakes before? ' + yorn);
>if(fearQuakes.toLowerCase() === 'yes' || fearQuakes.toLowerCase === 'y'){
>  alert('NOOOO. Maybe if I did, I wouldn\'t be so scared');
>}else{
>  alert('No earthquakes yet, but my parents have had two in Madison, Mississippi in the last 4 years. Fracking awesome, right?');
>}
>console.log(userName + ' knows I\'ve never experienced the earth quake?' + fearQuakes);
